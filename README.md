# All My Cheatsheets

Just a backup of all my cheatsheets. The purpose of this repository is giving me a quick access to them regardless the place in which I am. As well as, share them with the community and other developers.

*Take into consideration that most of those documents cost tons of time to their creators (not me), so you should not distribute them without their authorization*

Cheatsheets where classified in folders by topics. Here it's the tree:
